# Encrypt-and-Decrypt--by-vigenere-cipher
Encryption: Encrypts plain text into ciphertext using a specified keyword. Decryption: Decrypts ciphertext back into plain text using the correct keyword. Modularity: Clear and organized code structure for easy understanding and modification. Efficiency: Optimized for performance to handle large text inputs. plaintext = "ATTACKATDAWN" keyword = "LEMON" ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, keyword) print(ciphertext) # Output: LXFOPVEFRNHR
